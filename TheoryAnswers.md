## Question 1
Design Heuristics consist of 10 Usability Heuristics, pioneered by Jakob Nielsen, which were created as a guide for developers to refer to for design choices. Each Heuristic provides speicifc needs which need to be met in order to provide best practices and usability for the end user.

"Matching between system and real world", also known as H2, is the second Heuristic in Neilsen's framework. This Heuristic advises developers that their design should contain familiarity for their users. This would include concepts, wording/terms, images and logic that the user is already accustomed to. The reason for this Heuristic is to create natural mapping - minimising the amount a user needs to rely on their memory and understanding to use the system or preform tasks. Therefore, by following real world conventions, the design will make it easer for users to get to the desired outcomes as the system will be simpler for them to use and they will retain the information on how the interface works.

An example of H2 not being met, therefore causing a usability problem, would be a university application for students having a library card available on the app but not a student ID card. 
The reason for this violation would be since, in the real world, students would use their student ID card as their library card, therefore, would not have the need to carry both but in the application there is a distinct difference between the two cards and this creates inconsistancy with their real world experience, as the card on the app would only be used for the library and not for all Student ID purposes. Therefore, if the app did not have a digital version of their Student ID, they would still need to carry the physical copy, and this does not align with the real world use case and create confusion.

Overall, advantages of adhereing to this heuristic would be:

Higher user satisfcation - Users will be less frustrated with the system if they can use the it without intervention and learning new concepts. They will run into less errors and be able to complete tasks and get their desired outcome on their own, based on concepts they are already used to.

Increased accessability - More people would be able to use the system, if it mimics real world concepts and familiarity, because less technical knowledge and logic would be required, therefore, anyone of any level of understanding and those with cognitive disabilities can easily use the system.

Quicker onboarding - Reduced training will be required for users and it will be simpler to introduce to new users since the concepts are already known and a huge learning curve will be avoided.

Overall, design heuistics are important to adhere to for an imporved user experience. In regards to heuristic Matching Between System and Real World, many advantages are linked by implementing this due to familiarity of previous concepts.
